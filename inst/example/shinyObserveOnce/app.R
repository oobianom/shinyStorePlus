         the first time a user interacts with the app.
         For example, it could be used to display
         a welcome modal or a cookie acceptance prompt

         the initial interaction, these elements will
         not appear again, even if the user refreshes
         the app or closes and reopens it later. This

         by preventing repetitive prompts and maintaining a
         clean interface for returning users.")
